Subject: Github Project \'{}\''

Hi {}!

I noticed you gave my project \'{}\' ({}) a star on Github.
First of all: thank you for that! :)

I would like to improve the project by taking into consideration your specific needs and wishes. That is why I would greatly appreciate it if you could send me a  short reply with some information about yourself, why you gave a star to the project or features you would like to see included in the future.
I am also open to discuss other follow up projects or good ideas that you might have. So just hit me up!

Cheers!
